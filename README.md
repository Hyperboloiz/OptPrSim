Option Pricing Simulation

1. 
randomTemplate.cpp
plotbyOctave.m
values.txt

a normal distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance 1. Using template random, which is light-weight. 
values.txt stores the values. 'values.txt' should be generated each time when randomTemplate runs. 
plotbyOcatave plots the points 


2. 
geomBMnaive.cpp
plotBM.m

Simulation of paths of geometric brownian motion, using random generator gsl_rng. Plot by Octave. Random seed set by time. So txt files of path should
be generated differently each time.
